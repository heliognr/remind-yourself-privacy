  <h1>Privacy Policy for Remind Yourself</h1>
  <p><strong>Remind Yourself</strong> does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users.</p>
  <p>The app runs locally on your device and does not transmit any data to external servers. Its core functionality is to allow users to create and manage reminders with audio and visual notifications.</p>
  <p>The app accesses system-level notifications and may run in the background (system tray) to ensure that scheduled reminders are triggered on time. These operations do not involve access to user files, online data, or personally identifiable information.</p>
  <p>Users can optionally use custom audio files for reminders. These files are selected by the user from their local system and are not accessed or transmitted by the app.</p>
  <p>The app provides light and dark themes, as well as user interface effects (such as strobe, shake, or color shift) solely for visual customization and user engagement.</p>
  <p>By using Remind Yourself, you agree that no personal information is shared with the developer or any third party.</p>
